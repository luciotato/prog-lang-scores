CT-Tools:

* LISP Itself. You have the entire language power at CT for code generation.

* LISP uses duck-typing, so generic programming is the norm. Of course duck-typing affects performance.

Readability
-----------

**RE-I**: Readability Intended: 30/100

LISP is also known as "Lots of Irritating Superfluous Parentheses".
Lisp expression must be read inside-out to understand what the code is doing. 

**RE-NO**: Readability Naturally occurring: 20/100

**RE-LA**: Resistance to Language-Abuse: 5/100

Syntax-flexibility: 100/100
--------------------------

* everything is a expression
* highly composable expressions
* everything is dynamically created
