Readability
-----------

**RE-I: Readability Intended: 95/100**

*Line read: GREAT*

*Readability and Error handling: GREAT*

* Exceptions (with finally-clause)

**RE-NO: Readability Naturally occurring: 90/100**

**RE-LA: Resistance to Language-Abuse: 90/100**

* No CT-Power
* No Operator overloading


Meta-Power:  40/100
---------

* Python do not have CT-tools built-in, but...

* Python uses duck-typing, so generic programming is the norm. Of course duck-typing affects performance.
